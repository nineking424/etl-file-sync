# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## External Documentation

Always use Context7 MCP tools when generating code, setting up configurations, or providing library/API documentation. Automatically resolve library IDs and fetch documentation without requiring explicit user requests.

## Git Workflow

All changes must be committed to git and pushed to the remote repository.

### Rules
- **Mandatory Commit**: Every code change must be committed to git
- **Mandatory Push**: Always push commits to the remote repository after committing
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, meaningful commit messages in Korean (한글)
- **Atomic Commits**: Make commits in logical units (one feature/fix per commit)
